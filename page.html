        <p>
            My music taste is very unique and has evolved over the past couple of years.
            I've chose these 3 songs because they've all been songs that I've had on repeat for long periods of time or songs that I could simply come back to at any time and still
            think that its a classic. They all are hip-hop but all have some sense of melody to them that makes them easy to listen to. I'd also say that they all deliver something
            different than whats commonly delivered within the mainstream rap genre. The three songs I chose are <b>Last Claim by Dbangz</b>, <b>Hatchback by Cochise</b>, and
            finally <b>Been Gettin' Money by yvngxchris</b>. 
            <br> <br>
            With Last Claim by Dbangz, he delivers his lines regarding past relationships and his readiness moving forward in a very fast and well versed delivery. In Hatchback by
            Cochise, he shows us a new sounds where his voice is somewhat higher in tone or pitch, further sticking out on his anime inspired beats where he wears his inspiration
            on his sleeve. The final song, Been Gettin' Money by yvngxchris, Chris delivers his rash and, at times, comedic lines in a very aggressive sound, which makes him
            stick out from the crowd of other generic soundcloud rappers.
